SRV Tracker keeps track of your location while on planet surfaces and also uploads this information to a server for live race tracking purposes.  This includes writing current leaderboard and participant status to text files that can be used in streams.

The only information that is accessed is that exposed in the status.json file that Elite Dangerous continuously updates while you are playing.  This file contains status information and location only.  By default, server upload is NOT enabled.  If you only want to use SRVTracker for local route planning and tracking, it will work in that mode without needing the server.  Logs are stored on the server for a short time, but only in memory.  Currently, last known status of a commander is also maintained indefinitely, though this is likely to change.  Nothing other than commander name and the contents of the status.json file are shared.  The server does not log any additional information.

Most features are now fully working.  Please feel free to report any bugs via Discord or Github.  VR support is experimental.
