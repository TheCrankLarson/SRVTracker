SRV Tracker keeps track of your location while on planet surfaces and can also upload this information to a server for live race tracking purposes. 

The only information that is accessed is that exposed in the status.json or the journal files that Elite Dangerous continuously updates while you are playing.  These files contain in-game information only.  Absolutely no personal information is collected.

By default, server upload is NOT enabled.  If you only want to use SRVTracker for local route planning and tracking, it will work in that mode without needing the server (and will not send any data outside your computer).  Race logs are stored on the server (which I manually delete from time to time).  Currently, last known status of a commander is cleared if no update received for more than 60 seconds.  The only data that is sent to and/or stored on the server is Commander name and events from status.json or the journal.  The server does not log any additional information (e.g. IP address).

You can enable auto-update from Tracker settings (the Tracker is the first, main window).  Checks will be made on start-up and on tick (i.e. when you enable it).

No warranties are provided with this software, nor guarantees of fitness for any purpose.  Use it at your own risk.

Most features are now fully working.  Please feel free to report any bugs via Github.  VR support is experimental, but surprisingly effective.
